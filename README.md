Snippets makes it easier to organize and save code for later use.


## Overview
Searching for logic needed to make your app work often takes __A LOT__ of googling and review of hundreds of lines of code. Snippets is a place where you can select a category (i.e., HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sequelize) and save code or links that can be stored and retreived when needed for future projects.
