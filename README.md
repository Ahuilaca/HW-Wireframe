# Snippets
Snippets makes it easier to organize and save blocks of code for later use.


## Basic Overview
Searching for logic needed to make your app work often takes __A Lot__ of googling and review of hundreds of lines of code. Snippets is a place where you can select a category (i.e., HTML, CSS, Javascript, Sequelize) and save code or links that can be stored for later reference.
